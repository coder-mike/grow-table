# Grow Table

Arduino sketch for a grow table controller for plants.

See [coder-mike.com/grow-table](https://coder-mike.com/grow-table/).

Note: this Arduino project depends on the libraries:

- Timezone
- Time
- NTPClient

To actually put the code on a device, I copy it into the Arduino Cloud Editor.
